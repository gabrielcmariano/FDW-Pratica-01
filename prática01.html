    <h1>Astronomy and its branches</h1>
    <p id='p1', class='fonte'>
        I would like to introduce two different branches of Astronomy, and a complement of them stepping ahead to physics itself.
        The first one we're going to talk about, is Astrophysics.
        <br> Astrophysics is, by far, my favorite subject when it comes to the Universe. Why so? 
        Because it's simply astonishing how things work on our immeasurable and beautiful Universe.
        <br>So, basically, Astrophysics is the branch of astronomy that employs the principles of physics and chemistry to ascertain the nature of the astronomical objects, rather than their positions or motions in space.
    </p>
    <p id='p2', class='fonte'>
        That being said, we can step up to our next subject, which is Cosmology.
        <br>Cosmology is a branch of astronomy concerned with the studies of the origin and evolution of the universe, from the Big Bang to today and on into the future.
        <br>It is the scientific study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe.
    </p>
    <p id='p3', class='fonte'>
        Now, to end up our brief speaking, I will explain a little bit of the most known branch of physics that first comes to our mind when we talk about the Universe.
        <br>Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that employs mathematical models and abstractions of physical objects and systems to rationalize, explain and predict natural phenomena.
        <br> In other words, a theoretical physicist deals all the time with theories that encompass the Universe itself and all its branches.
        <br>That was the Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein and nowadays, Michio Kaku's job.
